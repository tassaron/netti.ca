<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One night, when I was young, my mother
wasn't home to set my bath...... Being young and naive, I thought it
I could set it up myself. I was wrong. As I was pouring in the bubble
bath, my foot slipped and I plunged head first into the mercilous
water of my 5 by 3 bathtub. As a sank into the shallow waters, and
the air escaped my lungs, I didn't know which way was up, which way
was down, or whether or not that yellow liquid was coming out of me.
A few seconds later when the mild confusion had passed I barely
escaped with my life. It was a horrible event, sean....... that has
left me traumitized.  ever since that day, I have never been the
same....</P>

haven't bathe myself since.</P>

over me.</P>
